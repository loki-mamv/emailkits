# EmailKits — Full Documentation

## Overview

EmailKits is a self-serve email/newsletter template builder created by MAMV Ventures. It solves a specific problem: building good-looking HTML emails is unnecessarily painful. Email HTML is nothing like web HTML — it requires nested tables, inline styles, Outlook-specific conditionals, and testing across dozens of rendering engines.

EmailKits removes all of that complexity. You pick a template, fill in a form with your content (headlines, body text, images, links, brand colors), and get a complete, tested HTML email file ready to paste into any email platform.

## The Problem EmailKits Solves

Email template development is uniquely difficult because:
1. Every email client renders HTML differently (Gmail strips styles, Outlook uses Word's rendering engine, etc.)
2. Modern CSS features don't work — you're stuck with table-based layouts and inline styles
3. Responsive email requires specific techniques that differ from responsive web design
4. Free templates look generic and unprofessional
5. Custom email design costs $500+ per template from a specialist
6. Drag-and-drop editors are locked behind monthly subscriptions ($20-50/month)

## How It Works

1. **Pick a template** — Choose from 6+ professionally designed email layouts (newsletters, welcome sequences, product launches, digests, announcements, minimal text-forward)
2. **Fill in your content** — Use a simple form interface to enter your headline, body copy, images, links, colors, and branding. No code knowledge required.
3. **Download and send** — Get production-ready HTML that's been tested across 60+ email clients. Paste it into your email platform (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Beehiiv, Buttondown, SendGrid, etc.).

## Templates Available

- **The Weekly** — Clean newsletter layout with distinct content sections, ideal for regular sends
